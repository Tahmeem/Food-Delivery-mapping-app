# Food-Delivery-mapping-app

This was a mapping tool created similar to bigger maps such as google maps. It covered a lot of major cities around the world Toronto, London, New York etc. In addition, it had markers displaying common attractions in cities like restaurants, landmarks, hotels etc. Since this was mainly made for food delivery there were search tools created for restaurants and algorithms made for fast delivery. Source code cannot be published because it was a course project.
